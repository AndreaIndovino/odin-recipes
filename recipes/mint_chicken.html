    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>A favorite <strong>family recipe</strong> that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. <br>
        Fresh <em>lemon juice</em> and <em>mint leaves</em> are a must! <br>
        Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. <br>
                Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
                Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. </li> 
            <li>Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, <br>
                just until the chicken is cooked through. </li>
        </ol>

    <p2><b>Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough!</b></p2>
